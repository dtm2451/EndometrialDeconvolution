# Whole-tissue deconvolution and scRNAseq analysis identify altered endometrial cellular compositions and functionality associated with endometriosis
This repository is a companion to a study that carefully applies cell type deconvolution analysis to publicly available eutopic endometrial tissue transcriptional profiles. In addition to applying the xCell algothim to this microarray data, we also describe and apply methods for assessing how well the standard signtaures of the xCell algorithm, which were built on non-endometrial samples, might match with actual cognate cell type signatures of the target endometrial tissue.

This repository is currenty under construction as the masuscipt is under review. If you use the repository, we ask that you cite the paper in any publications that follow:
